I created Twitter screen name TweetTesterNET (see TweetTesterNET_Creds.json).  
You can use TweetTesterNET to read tweets and retweets 
by TweetTesterNET's friends (users that TweetTesterNET follows).

To use your own Twitter screen name with this app, go to: https://apps.twitter.com/

Sign in and create a new app under your Twitter login. 
With the credentials, create a file similar to TweetTesterNET_Creds.json:
<your screen name>_Creds.json

At runtime, <screen name>_GroupSettings.json will be created and used
when you move user around groups.
